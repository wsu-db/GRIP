# Introduction
GRIP is a system which exploits data constraints to clarify missing answers for graph queries. (1) Constraint-based explanation. Given a desired yet missing entity in the query answer, GRIP ensures to generate finite and minimal sequences of data con- straints (an “explanation”) that should be consecutively enforced to 𝐺 to ensure its occurrence for the same query. (2) Answering “why” and “how” questions. Users can query GRIP with both “Why” (“Why” the element is missing) and “How” questions (“How” to refine the graph to include the missing answer). GRIP engine supports run- time generation of explanations by incrementally maintaining a set of bi-directional search trees. (3) Interactive exploration. GRIP provides user-friendly GUI to support interactive ad visual explo- ration of explanations, including both automated generation and step-by-step inspection of graph manipulations.
